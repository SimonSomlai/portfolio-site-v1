        <h2>current state</h2>

        <p>During Apple’s most recent event in early <a href="#">September</a>, the world tuned in to hear about Apple Watch’s watchOS2, the updated technology designed to bring its wearable device to the next level. This was then followed by HTC’s anticipated announcement of its first Android Wear smartwatch Halfbeak.</p>

        <p>With the launch of new devices and enhancements to existing technologies, these companies have captured consumers’ attention, who are <a href="#">obsessed with wearables</a>. And with IDC research finding that the global wearable market has grown 223.2 percent in 2Q 2015, there is no better time for brands to ensure they are capturing the hearts and wallets of current and future wearable device owners.</p>

        <h2>there's an app for that</h2>

        <p>Apps are the top concern for consumers interested in wearables, with 27 percent of social media conversations circling around app availability. There’s no doubt that apps are ubiquitous in our daily lives “ they get us to the airport and boarded on the plane, provide the <a href="#">latest score for the big game</a> and even let us chat in two different languages in real-time.</p>

        <p>Apple has recognized this massive desire for third-party apps by offering over 10,000 watch apps on its App Store. In order for brands to get out ahead of the competition, the abundance of apps must be present to ensure that their wearable purchase will enhance their daily lives rather than be an expensive tech accessory.</p>
